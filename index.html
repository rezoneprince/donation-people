            <p>Flood-affected people are not eating day after day. They have no place to stay. The house is submerged. There is no news anywhere. Not sleeping and spending day after day. After a few days I get a small amount of news. Waterborne diseases are on the rise. Farmland is ruined. The road is broken. The communication system has deteriorated. Therefore, all the people of the country should stand by the flood-hit people with relief. Let's all deal with the flood.</p>
